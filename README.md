# Eric Cato Jr.’s Portfolio 💻🛡️☁️

I’m driven by a strong interest in cybersecurity and a passion for understanding how systems, networks, and data can be protected against real-world threats. I approach technology as both a problem-solver and a learner, blending technical skills across IT, security, and business to build reliable and secure solutions. I enjoy working across different domains, adapting quickly, and continuously strengthening my defensive security mindset.

I’m currently a senior at the University of Louisville pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems, with concentration tracks in Cybersecurity and Business Process Management. My academic focus has provided a strong foundation in network security, digital forensics, systems analysis, and the intersection between business processes and secure technology design.

I actively hold industry-recognized certifications including CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900). Alongside my studies, I am currently working as an IT Support Intern, where I gain hands-on experience supporting enterprise environments and end users. In this role, I regularly work with Active Directory to manage user accounts, groups, and file permissions; image and deploy Windows devices; troubleshoot hardware, software, and network-related issues; and assist with endpoint security tools used to protect organizational assets. This experience has strengthened my understanding of day-to-day IT operations, security best practices, and the importance of clear documentation and collaboration.

My technical skill set continues to grow across multiple areas, including network security, digital forensics, endpoint security, virtualization, cloud-based environments, and SQL databases. I actively build labs and projects to reinforce concepts learned in coursework, particularly in security monitoring, incident analysis, and defensive security techniques. My long-term career goal is to begin as a SOC Analyst, where I can further develop detection and response skills, and eventually pivot into cloud security.

This GitHub serves as a professional portfolio showcasing my cybersecurity labs, IT projects, cloud-based experiments, and technical documentation. I’m eager to connect with professionals and organizations focused on strengthening their security posture and building resilient digital environments through thoughtful, proactive security practices.
