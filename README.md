# Eric Cato Jr.’s Portfolio 💻🛡️☁️

I’m driven by a strong interest in cybersecurity and a passion for understanding how systems, networks, and data can be protected against real-world threats. I approach technology as both a problem-solver and a continuous learner, blending IT, security, and business knowledge to build reliable and secure solutions.

I’m currently a senior at the University of Louisville pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems with concentration tracks in Cybersecurity and Business Process Management. My academic background has provided a strong foundation in network security, digital forensics, systems analysis, and secure technology design aligned with business processes.

I hold industry-recognized certifications including CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), and I currently work as an IT Support Intern supporting enterprise environments. This GitHub serves as a professional portfolio showcasing my cybersecurity labs, programming projects, and technical documentation as I work toward starting my career as a SOC Analyst and eventually moving into cloud security.
